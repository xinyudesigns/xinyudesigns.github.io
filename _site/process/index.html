  <li>
    <p>Identify the client, learn about their brand (their audience, their problem, competitors, etc.), and figure out what pages to redesign for the site<br />
I ended up picking the home page, the about page, the program page, the find an event page, and the organize an event page.<br />
p.s. since it’s a redesign project, I didn’t create a site map for this project.</p>

<!-- why the earth day 2014 website?
To attend the iron yard, I moved down to Austin about 4 months ago. one thing i noticed when i moved down here is Austin is s a very green eco-friendly city; no plastic grocery bags, recycling is a very big thing.  so earth day, which is world’s largest civil observance is coming up this month on the 22nd. you may be like, okay i definitely care about the earth, but is there anything else i can do other than turning off my lights for an hour. so the earth day 2014 website aims to give you all the info you needed whether to find an event near you or to organize an event. they really wanna engage everyone, especially the younger generation. but it’s current website didn’t reflect it’s inviting contemporary voice. it looks very dull, the color palette is black and dark blue and on a white background, so what i wanna do is to redesign the 2014 website that will engage viewer, especially the younger audience. i want to give out a clean and friendly vibe, using brighter color, and adding some more eye-catching elements and better images.  -->

<!-- 1. Brainstorm  
I first listed the content that I want to include on the page I'm wireframing.  

2. Organize my content list
Create relationships between the page content I've listed - what will you group together? What's highest priority to be read first? 
Determine how you'll want to treat any actions on this page - how important is each and what preference do you want to convey to the user? (ex. button vs. text link) 

3. Sketch page layout
Include what content will go where.
Remember to consider type weight when creating hierarchy.
Share your sketch on your project page and offer feedback to your fellow classmates. 

4. Create my wireframe
Start wireframing! The medium is open ended, be it scanned in sketches, Powerpoint, Illustrator, HTML, whatever you have at your disposal and feel fastest in.
Add more pages
Wireframing a couple of pages is ideal. It can be any type of site that you want, though my example is for a portfolio website.
Finish your wireframe
Share your progress in your project section to get feedback from other students.

Additional Resources
Here are some questions you should be thinking through while watching the lectures for this unit: 
What do you want to get across to viewers of your site?
What content belongs on your site? What's the relative importance of each piece of content?
How can you use the language of wireframes and UI patterns to convey functionality, content and hierarchy?
See the full-sized examples referenced in the lectures here:

Itching to get started? Here are the resources that I've compiled that I find particularly useful as I'm wireframing. Please comment if you find any other resources that are helpful; let's get a big list going!Video

Choosing a tool to execute your wireframes with is a personal decision; it depends on the level of fidelity that you're looking for and whatever you feel most comfortable with. What may work well for one person or project may not work for another. This post will be most helpful if you've watched video 5 of my lecture. Here are the tools I've curated.
